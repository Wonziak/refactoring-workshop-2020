CMake Error at DynamicEvents/CMakeLists.txt:8 (add_library):
  add_library INTERFACE library requires no source arguments.


CMake Error at DynamicEvents/CMakeLists.txt:9 (add_dependencies):
  Cannot add target-level dependencies to non-existent target
  "DynamicEvents".

  The add_dependencies works for top-level logical targets created by the
  add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target commands.  If you want to
  add file-level dependencies see the DEPENDS option of the add_custom_target
  and add_custom_command commands.


CMake Error at DynamicEvents/CMakeLists.txt:10 (target_include_directories):
  Cannot specify include directories for target "DynamicEvents" which is not
  built by this project.
